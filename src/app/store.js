// persistStore: The persistStore function is used to create a persisted version of the Redux store.
//  It takes the Redux store as an argument and returns a persistor object. The persistor object provides 
//  methods for controlling the persistence process, such as persistor.persist() to trigger the actual 
//  storing of the state and persistor.purge() to remove the persisted state.

// persistReducer: The persistReducer function is used to wrap your root reducer with persistence functionality.
//  It takes a configuration object and the root reducer as arguments and returns a new reducer. The configuration 
//  object specifies how and where the state should be persisted, including options like the storage system,
//   whitelist/blacklist of reducers to persist, and transformation functions.

// Handling state rehydration: The newly created reducer, which includes the persistence logic, automatically
//  handles the state rehydration process. When the application restarts, the persisted state is retrieved from 
//  the storage system, and the wrapped reducer uses this persisted state as the initial state of the Redux store.
//   This ensures that the application starts with the previously saved state, preserving the user's data and interactions.
